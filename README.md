# Smart_Waste_Management_System
This platform is implemented as a solution to manage waste with smart technology.

The residents can make requests to get new bins , repair existing bins and replace bins by selecting a type of the bin (Paper/Plastic/Food Waste).
When making any requests the residents must make a payment so that the system have a monetary gain for its existance.
Each bin is given a QR code so that the details and waste level of the bin can be monitered. 

Through the Waste manager , waste collectors are informed to collect the waste and to fulfill the bin requests by the residents.
Any problem or issue related to the service or waste collectors can be reported to the waste managers by Residents.

Admin manages users and analyze the status of the system.

We used React Native and Mongo DB along with Node js and Express js to develop this mobile project.

This is the project we did for our 3rd year 1st semester CSSE(Case Studies in Software Engineering) module.
